DNSMezzo
========

DNSmezzo is a framework for the capture and analysis of DNS packets. It
allows the manager of a DNS name server to get information such as the
top N domains requests, the percentage of IPv6 queries, the most
talkative clients, etc. It is part of the broader program DNSwitness.

DNSmezzo is optimized for periodic, unattended runs, for instance from a
cron job. Results are typicallly stored in a databse, most of the time a
rDBMS, to allow long-term surveys.

Developed at AFNIC, mostly by Stéphane Bortzmeyer.
Some modifications in reporting were made by Dániel Süttő.

Requirements:
-------------
Tipically you will need the following things:
 * A libpcap compatible dumping utility
 * PostgreSQL
 * A C compiler
 * Python with Postgresql support (pycopg2)
 * xsltproc
 * libpq
 * libpcap
 * ...

Installation and usage:
-----------------------
 I.) Prepare database
   * Create new user and database:
       CREATE USER dns_monitor WITH CREATEDB  PASSWORD '********';
       CREATE DATABASE dns with owner dns_monitor;
   * Install tables and predefined constants:
       cat create.sql | psql -U dns_monitor -h 127.0.0.1
     Optionally you can update dns-parameters:
       wget http://www.iana.org/assignments/dns-parameters
       ./dnsparameters2sql.py > dns-parameters.sql
       cat dns-parameters.sql | psql -U dns_monitor -h 127.0.0.1
   * Install extra SQL libraries
       cat util-functions.sql | psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres dns_monitor
       cat tablefunc.sql | psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres dns_monitor

 II.) Compile parser
   Simply run make. Install required libraries and try again. :D
     make
 
 III.) Collect dns traffic in standart pcap files.

 IV.) Save DNS packets into database
     Use packets2postgresql or rewrite store-to-db script.

 V.) Genarate reports
     cd reporting/sajat
   Rewrite installation path in Makefile
     make install "DATE=2011/11/03"
