* Improve the performance of packets2postgresql (currently too
  slow). See
  <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/populate.html>. Use
  COPY? Suppress index before?

* Finalize the domain name type

* Extract more info such as EDNS option codes (for techniques such as
  EDNS0-ping)

* Parse and store the sections Answer and Authority (not obvious since
  they require domain name parsing with compression pointers. And they
  can be huge and take room in the database.

* More reporting
